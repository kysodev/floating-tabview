#  Floating TabView
Feel free to use this as a base template to achieve a popout menu effect from the TabView.
<br>
If you wish to add a custom animation that includes an additional view (such as the blue view that appears when the Popout menu buttons appear or a slight blur for example) I have added some information in the FloatingCustomTabView.swift file.
